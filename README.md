A simple irrigation controller using one of the cheap FTDI relay
boards.

## Philosophy

We have spent too much money and water manually turning on irrigation
zones, and leaving them on for too long. This is a simple irrigation
controller to let us run our irrigation valves with our smart phones.

The HTML interface of this needs a lot of work. It's minimal and not
yet dynamic.

This thing depends on my libfby C++ library, and is a stand-alone HTTP
server.
